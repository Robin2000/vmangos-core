 World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.9.0 (2006-01-03)
 - All versions of the quests "A Donation of Wool," "A Donation of 
   Silk," and "A Donation of Mageweave" have had the level of the quest 
   raised so that higher level characters performing them will be able 
   to receive the full reputation gain. The minimum level requirement 
   for the quests have not changed, though the amount of XP gained when 
   completing any of these quests will be different than from before. 
   Mageweave will continue to give more XP than Silk, and Silk more XP 
   than Wool.

 World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.9.0 (2006-01-03)
 - The quests "Morrowgrain to Darnassus" and "Morrowgrain to Thunder 
   Bluff" now give increased reputation per turn-in to be in line with
   the amount given with "Morrowgrain to Feathermoon Stronghold."

 - The following repeatable quests have had their levels increased to 
   55: Morrowgrain to Darnassus, Morrowgrain to Feathermoon Stronghold, 
   and Morrowgrain to Thunder Bluff. The net result of this change is 
   that level 56+ characters will notice an increased amount of 
   reputation when turning in Morrowgrain.
   
 World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.3.0 (2005-03-22)

   Feathermoon Stronghold has been increased to 10 packets of seeds per 
   five morrowgrain.
   
 Comments for Morrowgrain to Feathermoon Stronghold
 
 From Allakhazam
 By Heruril on 2005/05/12 (Patch 1.4.2)		
 Subject: "Rep"
 This quest gives 16 rep pts for darnassus at lvl 57.
 
 From Allakhazam
 By vttale on 2006/01/26 (Patch 1.9.2)		
 Subject: "1.8 patch"
 With the 1.8 patch it gives 25 rep for everyone, even level 60.
 Returning to Darnassus gives 50 rep but takes 10 morrowgrain,
 so from a rep perspective it makes no difference which one you return to.
 Only the additional potion vs seed packet rewards really makes the difference.
