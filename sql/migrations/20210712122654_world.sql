I couldn\'t help but to notice her captivating beauty as well.  She is on the cusp of womanhood now.  Supposedly the Lord has arranged her marriage for next year.  But I digress.  This week I will accompany the family to their summer cottage near the Eastvale Logging Camp in Elwynn, close to the Red Ridge Mountains.  I hope to write more while there.', 0),

As I was instructing Giles in the meaning of numbers, Tilloa appears before me with a suitor, holding hands in public nonetheless!  What an uncouth young man.  Rather than introduce me properly, Tilloa simply said, "Oh that\'s just my tutor, Uncle Stalvan.  He\'s a nice old man."  Old!  At that word my cheeks flushed with heat.  I am but a few years older and yet she betrays. . .', 0),
